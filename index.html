                         <h3>The 5th Fastest Ford Car</h3>
                            <p class="para">Ford Mustang Mach-1 (0-60 in 4.5 seconds)
                            The Mustang Mach-1 returns in 2021 for the first time in 17 years, with 5.0 liter V-8 engine that gives it 480 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. <br>
                            With a starting price of around <span>$50,000,</span> the Mach-1 is comparable to the Mustang Bullit and has similar specs. Critics like Richard Hammond have praised <br>
                            the recent improvement in handling saying “It’s some time since we’ve been able to laugh at Mustangs for handling like a grand piano in an ice rink. But <br>
                            the current generation Ford have sorted it. They’ve dragged the Mustang kicking and screaming into this century.”</p><button>Read More</button>
